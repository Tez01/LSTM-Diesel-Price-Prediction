# LSTM-Diesel-Price-Prediction
![](https://github.com/Tez01/LSTM-Diesel-Price-Prediction/blob/master/diesel.png)
This is Keras implementation of Diesel price prediction using LSTM. The model takes in input data from previous 90 days and predicts price for the next day.

The model is implemented using Keras(Tensorflow 1.12 as backend)

Dependencies:
Tensorflow-1.12
matplotlib
sklearn
graphviz
pydot
numpy pandas

Use requirements.txt file and on the command-line use 
pip install requirements.txt
